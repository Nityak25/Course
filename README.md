## Description of the Chat Bot
The ChatBot that we had implimented can give the list of all courses from the VEDIC platform and also gives the recorded session links for all the courses

## Working of the Chat Bot
### First step
---
* By greeting() function it welcomes you to the chat bot<br/>

* The ChatBot introduces itself by telling it's name and by telling what it can do for user to the user with an welcome message.

### Second step
---
* ChatBot will ask the name of the user<br/>
* After entering the name of user ChatBot will greats the user with his/her name. Here in this greating we are highliting the name of user in capital letters for best view.

### Third step
---
* By Course_displayer() function we can get the courses in the vedic platform<br/>
 * ChatBot will listout the courses list of VEDIC platform with numbering and it also asks user to enter course number of which course he/she wants to do.
<br/>
 
##### if the input is valid it will proceed and if not it goes to exception.

### Fourth step
---
* By Course_info() function we can get all about course and classes and user have to select the class

### Five step

* By Linkgetter() function we can get class link<br/> 
* ChatBot will give the link of the recorded session for the class which was selected by the user.
<br/>

##### if the input is valid it will proceed and if not it goes to exception.

### Six step

* It will tell to the user that "You can access me at any time if want any information".
